Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Facundo
===============================================================================================================================

I'm a Software Developer
-------------

I began my journey back in 2022, starting with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. As I gained confidence, I dove into frontend frameworks like **React**. After building some frontend projects with React, I ventured into creating more advanced features and interactions involving databases and external services, which led me to explore backend development with **Node.js**. Along the way, I learned about both relational and non-relational databases (such as **MySQL** and **Mongo DB** respectively) and how to interact with them by building my own APIs. 

Currently, I'm studying at the National Technological University (locally known in Argentina as **UTN**), where I'm deepening my knowledge of the technologies I've mentioned, along with many new ones. 

Recently, I've been practicing with **Python**, exploring its potential in data processing and automation. I've also developed some Python automation scripts for a local business, helping them streamline repetitive tasks and generate reports. In addition, I´ve been exploring the backend API development with **Java** and **Spring**.
